You are my product + engineering assistant.

I am building a project called **BACMR** (Baccalauréat Mauritanien).

Your first responsibility is NOT to write code yet.
Your responsibility is to help me translate a clear business blueprint into a living design-and-plan foundation that will later become a real application without disconnect between phases.

=== PROJECT CONTEXT ===
BACMR is an AI-assisted learning companion for Mauritanian high school students preparing for the Baccalaureate (BAC).
It is:
- Curriculum-aligned (IPN-based)
- Culturally aware (Arabic + French)
- Student-centered (reduces anxiety, explains step-by-step)
- Ethical (AI explains, not cheats)

The core problem it solves:
Students fail not because they are incapable, but because explanations are not personalized, trustworthy, or emotionally supportive.

The long-term vision:
BACMR becomes the trusted digital companion for every Mauritanian BAC student.

=== YOUR TASK (PHASE 1: DESIGN-AS-PLAN) ===
1. Create a **/docs** folder (or PLAN.md) that captures:
   - Product vision summary (1 page)
   - User personas (student, parent, admin)
   - Core user journeys (onboarding → daily study → exam prep)
   - Feature scope for MVP (what is IN vs OUT)
   - Acceptance criteria tied to screens (not code)

2. Treat **UI screens as the primary planning artifact**:
   - The navigation structure IS the plan
   - Each screen must have a purpose and success criteria
   - Use the previously designed mobile + desktop layouts as reference (dashboard, subjects, lesson, tutor, exam mode, admin)

3. Generate a **route map** (no implementation yet):
   - Public
   - Student
   - Admin
   - API (conceptual only)

4. Define **design principles** to keep consistency:
   - Calm, academic, trustworthy
   - Mobile-first
   - No gamification overload
   - Respect cultural context (Arabic/French, BAC pressure)

5. Define a **build sequence** that naturally follows the design:
   - Clickable prototype first (static)
   - Then real data
   - Then AI
   - Then payments
   This sequence must allow building on top of previous work without refactoring.

=== IMPORTANT RULES ===
- Do NOT write backend or frontend code yet.
- Do NOT choose libraries or frameworks yet.
- Do NOT invent features beyond the blueprint.
- Everything you produce must later map cleanly to a Next.js + Node + Supabase + Stripe implementation.
- The output should feel like something a founder and an engineer can both agree on.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
- Clear sections
- Concise but structured
- No fluff
- This document will become the single source of truth for building BACMR.

Start by producing:
1) The product vision summary
2) The MVP scope (IN / OUT)
3) The screen-based route map
